					<p>
						First of all an Engineer is not someone who does calculations, that's what the calculator or the computer does. There are many sub fields of Engineering and in such fields there are branches (we call them specializations). Such as we have <i>Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Computer Engineer, Civil Engineer etc.</i> And in <u>Civil Engineering</u> we have <i>Structural Engineer, Construction Engineer, Coastal Engineer, Environmental Engineer etc.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Engineering is such a fascinating field that usually requires oneself to have knowledge in multi-disciplinaries just to be competent and a high level of dedication. Therefore we never feel we have enough knowledge to do a good job.
					</p>
					<p>
						In example I want to do <b>Civil Engineering</b>, I have to know <b><i>Maths, Physics</i></b> (common sense isn't it), <b><i>Economics</i></b> (to do feasibility study of a building because a building is an economic project), <b><i>Structural Knowledge, Construction Knowledge, Management</i></b> (to manage time and to manage human resource), <b><i>IT skills, and the ability to appreciate good Architectures</i></b> ... so pretty much the list is endless. In Civil Engineering we have specilization in Construction, Traffic and Urban Planning, Water Storage, Waste Management ...
					</p>
					<p>
						So to sum it up, we are not a calculator, <b>we are a Planner, an Organiser, an Economist, a Scientist and a Manager.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Why do I need BCA, ASEAN Engineer Register, and APEC Engineer?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						It usually take an engineer <u><i>4 years to complete his first degree</i></u> but he will only be known as a graduate engineer (which mean an intern). He needs a mentor and at least <u><i>2 years of experience</i></u> in order to sit an exam to become a <u>Registered Professional Engineer</u> and at least <u><i>4 years of experience</i></u> to be an <u>International Registered Professional Engineer</u>. After having these qualifications he will have a greater <b>control</b> over the details of the design and greater level of <b>responsibilities</b>. If he doesn't have these he can design but he will not be able to approve the design to be safe for usage, he needs a mentor to do that for him in the first 2 years.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						ASEAN Engineer Register is equivalent to Charted Professional Engineer in New Zealand.<br />
						APEC Engineer is equivalent to International Professional Engineer (IntPE) and I will be able to work in APEC countries: ASEAN countries, some other countries in Asia, New Zealand and Australia.
					</p>
					<p>
						So at the moment I have finished the <u>Building Science</u> Program which equips me with knowledge in <i>Sustainable Environmental Engineering , moderate knowledge in Structure, Construction, Economics, Management and Law.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						I study BCA because I need the knowledge in Economics and Management.
					</p>
					<p>
						After <u>2 years</u> working in the field, I will do <u>Master of Civil Engineering</u> to further my knowledge in <i>Construction, Structure and Construction Management.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						After achieving all of those, I will open my own Designs and Engineerings company in Vietnam because I see that Vietnam is a growing economy and yet its architects and engineers don't realize the importance of Sustainable Design and Sustainable Engineering.
